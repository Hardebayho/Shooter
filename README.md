# Shooter

This is the repository for the Shooter game tutorial series on Youtube. You can do whatever you want with the source code. That's my license :)

# To Compile and Run
Clone this repository into your local workspace.
To compile and run this game on your system, you need to have the Allegro 5 Library installed. I assume you know how to compile and link to external libraries on C++. If you don't, just google a bit.
For the Linux users, it's pretty straightforward if you know how to use CMake. Inside the folder containing all these source files, just do inside a terminal `` mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make``. If all goes well, enter ``cd ..`` and then ``build/Shooter`` to run the executable. If all doesn't go well, check your installation of Allegro 5. 
For the Windows users, I'm sorry but you either have to copy the source files into a project already configured to work with the Allegro 5 library, or you just do it on your own. It should be fun though.
